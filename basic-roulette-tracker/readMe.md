BASIC ROULETTE TRACKER v1.0.5

Basic roulette tracker for Python.
I've searched around and I didn't find any created, mostly programs
based around roulette so I decided to create one.

Mind you, I understand this is probably not the "best in practice"
type of coding but really, I just wanted it done - didn't really
care for aesthetics or whatnot KEKW.

Enjoy!
